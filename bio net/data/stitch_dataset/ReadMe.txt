In our paper “Network inference with ensembles of bi-clustering trees” [1] we investigated the performance of our proposed method (eBICT) by extracting a subset of the chemical compound association database STITCH. More specifically, we employed the specific dataset in two versions. The first derives from STITCH v3.1 and the second from STITCH v4. 

The scores stored in STITCH stem from lab experiments, information from manually curated databases and computational approaches such as text mining. Thus, it is deducted that not all of those predicted associations can be translated as molecular interactions. This way we refer to the predicted links as associations instead of interactions.

The dataset is thoroughly described in:
